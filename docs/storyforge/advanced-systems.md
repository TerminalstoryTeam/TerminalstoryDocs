# Advanced AI Systems

## Core AI Systems

### Memory System
Our sophisticated memory system enables:
- Individual memory storage for each character
- Separate memory banks for narrator and DAEMON
- Memory impact scoring based on event significance
- Natural memory decay for less relevant information
- High-impact memories remain persistent
- Memory pruning based on relevance and time

### Character Processing
Characters utilize advanced processing cycles:
1. **Thought Generation**
   - Process current events
   - Consider implications
   - Generate emotional responses
   - Form opinions and beliefs

2. **Reflection System**
   - Analyze past experiences
   - Connect related events
   - Develop insights
   - Update worldview

3. **Growth Engine**
   - Learn from experiences
   - Develop new traits
   - Improve abilities
   - Evolve personality

### Story Generation
The AI manages story development through:
- Dynamic page calculation for optimal pacing
- Character-driven plot progression
- Automated chapter structuring
- Subplot integration
- Relationship development tracking
- World-building expansion

### Impact Scoring
Events and memories are scored based on:
- Emotional significance
- Plot relevance
- Character development impact
- Relationship effects
- World-building contribution
