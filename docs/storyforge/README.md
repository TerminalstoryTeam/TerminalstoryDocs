# StoryForge

StoryForge is the core story generation and interaction system of Terminal Story. It's where narratives come to life through the collaboration between AI and human creativity.

## What is StoryForge?

StoryForge is a matrix-like environment where:
- Stories are generated and evolve through AI and community interaction
- Characters develop unique personalities and motivations
- Readers can influence the story's direction through the SWAY system
- Multiple narrative threads can be explored and manipulated

## Key Components

### DAEMON Integration
DAEMON serves as your guide in StoryForge:

- Explains character motivations
- Offers suggestions for story development

Characters in StoryForge are dynamic entities:
- Develop based on story events
- Remember interactions
- Have unique personalities
- Can be influenced through SWAY
