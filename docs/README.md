## Technical Framework

Terminal Story is built on our proprietary framework that stands alongside ElizaOS and SWARMs in the AI agent ecosystem. While inspired by LangChain, we've developed our own comprehensive system:

### Advanced Memory Architecture
- **Multi-Memory System**: Enables consistent, self-personalizing AI agents
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Combines short-term and long-term memory
- **Impact-Based Storage**: Memories are stored and retrieved based on significance
- **Time Decay Integration**: Natural memory fade simulation
- **Creative Specialization**: Agents develop unique creative strengths

Our framework for creating multi-memory consistent AI agents will be released, offering developers the tools to build sophisticated, personalized AI agents with:
- Self-evolving personalities
- Dynamic response patterns
- Intelligent memory querying
- Impact-weighted memory storage
- Temporal memory management
